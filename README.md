# RCT2 Management Console (1.0.0)
Allows you to manage your Roller Coaster Tycoon server with a text based UI - 


---

Edit "rcmc" and change the settings at the top if your openrct2 server is not in /home/openrct-user/OpenRCT2.

You also need to have my OpenRCT2 Startup Script installed.

I suggest you then add this to your /home/openrct-user/.bashrc file:
	export PATH=/home/openrct-user/bin:/home/openrct-user/OpenRCT2_Manager:$PATH
You will need to install the required perl modules (as root):

- /home/openrct-user/OpenRCT2_Manager/installdeps


After that you should log out and back in and now "rcmc" should work.
